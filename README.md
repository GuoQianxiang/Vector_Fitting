# Vector_Fitting
## Calculators
- calculate_Residues
- fit_vector: make the fitting vector fit

## Data
- prepare some data for testing

## Drivers
- VF_Driver: drive the vector fitting
- RP_Driver: drive the xxx

## Loader
- data_loader: load the data from the Data directory

## Output
- The output of the calculator will be stored in this directory
- We will use the output data to test the function, which can guarantee the reliability of the function

## Test
- run_tests: we can run this command in the Test directory:
```python
cd Test
python3 run_tests.py
```
You can check the console output:
```
Ran 2 tests in 0.155s

OK
```
